        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "   - Object-Oriented Programming in Python is a way of organizing code using classes and objects.\n",
        "   - It helps group related data and actions together, making the code easier to manage and reuse.\n",
        "   - For example, if we have an Animal class, we can create a Dog and a Cat from it, each with their own sounds like \"Woof!\" and \"Meow!\".\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "   - A class in OOP is a blueprint for creating objects that share common attributes and methods.\n",
        "   - It defines how an object should look and act. For example, a Car class can have attributes like brand and color and a method drive() to describe its behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "   - An object in OOP  is a real-world entity created using a class.\n",
        "   - Each object has its own attributes and can perform methods defined in the class.\n",
        "   - For example, if Car is a class, my_car = Car(\"Toyota\", \"Red\") creates an object my_car with specific properties like brand and color.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "   - Abstraction is the process of hiding complex details and showing only the necessary features.\n",
        "   - It allows users to interact with a system without knowing how it works\n",
        "   - internally, like driving a car without understanding the engine mechanics.\n",
        "   - Encapsulation is the practice of restricting direct access to data and allowing controlled modifications through methods.\n",
        "   - It protects an object's data, like a bank account where the balance can't be changed directly but only through deposits or withdrawals.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "   - Dunder methods in Python are specific methods that begin and end with double underscores (for example, __init__, __str__).\n",
        "   - They are otherwise referred to as magic methods because they enable objects to communicate with built-in Python operations such as initialization, printing, and arithmetic.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP?\n",
        "   - Inheritance is an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concept where a child class inherits properties and functions from a parent class.\n",
        "   - It allows code reusability and enables creating a class hierarchy.\n",
        "\n",
        "7.  What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "   - Polymorphism is \"many forms\" and enables several classes to have the same method name but invoke different behaviors.\n",
        "   - It enables flexible and reusable code by enabling one interface to function with various data types or classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "   - Encapsulation in Python is realized through limiting direct object data access using private variable and protected variable attributes.\n",
        "   - Direct access is not allowed to private attributes, and protected attributes are not meant to be modified directly.\n",
        "   - Controlled access is enabled using getter and setter methods for data security and integrity.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "   - A Python constructor (__init__()) is a special method that is invoked automatically when an object is created.\n",
        "   - It is employed for initializing object attributes with particular values.\n",
        "   - For example, within a Car class, a constructor can define the car brand and color when a new car object is instantiated.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "    - A class method  operates on the class itself and alters class-level attributes, as a parameter cls.\n",
        "    - A static method is just a normal function within a class that does not rely on instance or class attributes.\n",
        "    - Class methods are employed to alter class variables, whereas static methods are employed for utility functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "    - Method overloading means that several methods can be declared with the same method name but differing parameters.\n",
        "    - It is possible using default parameters or *args/**kwargs for dealing with variable numbers of arguments.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "    - Method overriding takes place when a child class offers a new implementation of a method that is already declared in its parent class.\n",
        "    - The overridden method in the child class needs to have the same parameters and name as in the parent class.\n",
        "    - This enables the subclasses to tailor or modify the behavior of inherited methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "    - A Python decorator for property is applied to specify getter, setter, and deleter methods in an object-oriented manner.\n",
        "    - It can facilitate controlled access to class attributes with minimal and clear syntax.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "    -  Polymorphism is important in OOP due to the ability to treat dissimilar objects identically, to make code reusable, flexible, and scalable.\n",
        "    - It makes different classes share one common interface through the elimination of duplication and its enhancement of maintainability.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "   - An abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated and is intended to be a template for other classes.\n",
        "   - It should have at least one abstract method, which is a method declared but not defined in the parent class.\n",
        "   - Abstract classes are implemented using the ABC (Abstract Base Class) module.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "   - Inheritance facilitates reuse of code, eliminating redundancy.\n",
        "   - Conceals data by limiting direct access and permitting controlled modifications.\n",
        "   - Facilitates usage of a uniform interface for varied data types, making code more adaptable.\n",
        "   - Conceals intricate implementation details and provides only required functionalities.\n",
        "   - Groups code into objects, simplifying management, debugging, and expansion.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "   - A class variable belongs to all objects of a class and is declared outside of the methods, whereas an instance variable is specific to a particular object and declared within the constructor (__init__() ).\n",
        "   - Altering a class variable will impact all objects, whereas altering an instance variable will influence only that object.\n",
        "   - For instance, in a Car class, wheels = 4 may be a class variable (the same for every car), whereas brand may be an instance variable (different for every car).\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "   - Multiple inheritance enables a class to inherit from more than a single parent class, allowing access to attributes and methods from all the sources.\n",
        "   - This facilitates reusability of code but increases complexity, notably with the Diamond Problem resolved by the Method Resolution Order (MRO).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "19. Explain the purpose of '__str__' and '__repr__' methods in Python.\n",
        "   - The __str__() method gives a friendly string representation of an object and is invoked when printing object or converting object to str.\n",
        "   - The __repr__() method gives a representation that is friendly to developers, preferably one that can reconstruct the object, and is invoked by repr(object). If __str__() is not implemented, Python defaults to __repr__().\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the significance of the 'super()' function in Python?\n",
        "    - The super() function in Python is used to call methods from a parent class inside a child class.\n",
        "    - It is mainly used in inheritance to avoid redundant code and ensure that the parent class's methods are properly initialized.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "    - The __del__ method in Python is a destructor that is called when an object is about to be destroyed.\n",
        "    - It is used for cleanup tasks like closing files, releasing memory, or disconnecting from databases.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "    - A @staticmethod is a method that does not access instance (self) or class (cls) variables and is used for independent utility functions inside a class.\n",
        "    - A @classmethod takes cls as its first parameter and can access or modify class-level attributes.\n",
        "    - While static methods are like regular functions inside a class, class methods allow working with the class itself.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "    - Polymorphism with inheritance in Python allows a child class to override or extend methods from a parent class, enabling different classes to share the same method name but behave differently.\n",
        "    - This makes the code more flexible and reusable.\n",
        "\n",
        "24.  What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "    - Method chaining in Python OOP is an approach where several methods are called on the same object in one line, enhancing readability and minimizing code duplication.\n",
        "    - It is made possible by having each method return self so that the next method can be invoked on the same object.\n",
        "\n",
        "25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "    - Python's __call__ function enables a class instance to be called like a function.\n",
        "    - This enables objects to act like functions without losing state and encapsulation."
